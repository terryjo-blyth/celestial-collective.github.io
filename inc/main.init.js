My personal do's and don'ts.Take what information I've given you in this book and tailor itto your situation, every break up is different, but thefundamentals are the same it sucks and is painful. I'm justsharing what I've spoken to with other woman about andthey said it really helped them or they wish they had knownsooner. Do your own research, do what feels aligned to youand take what you like and leave what you don't. I thought compiling all the information into one spicy spotwould be the most helpful. I wish I had a guide on where togo, what to do, steps to take on moving through heartbreaklogically and emotionally. I hope this supports you on yourself love and healing journey.
